Modelling the Stock Market

My name is Jerome Blanchet, my educational background is in pure mathematics and economics. I am senior analyst at CMHC national office. This is my personal data science site at Github. This is actually my first notebook ever and I am very excited about it. I am interested about Numerai, a Silicon Valley firm focusing about predicting the Stock Market.
